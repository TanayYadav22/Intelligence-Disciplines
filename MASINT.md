# MEASUREMENT AND SIGNATURE INTELLIGENCE (MASINT)

MASINT is technical and scientific intelligence based on detecting distinct characteristics of targets.

## Disciplines:
- **Electro-Optical**: Infrared, laser detection, hyperspectral imaging.
- **Nuclear**: Radiation detection, nuclear energy sensors.
- **Geophysical**: Acoustic, seismic, magnetic, and gravitimetric sensors.
- **Radar**: SAR/ISAR imaging, passive radar.
- **Materials**: Chemical, biological, and radiological analysis.
- **Radiofrequency**: EM pulse, telemetry, unintended radiation emissions.

MASINT helps detect stealth objects, weapon launches, and hidden bunkers.
